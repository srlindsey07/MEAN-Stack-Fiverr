# Sixerr (Fiverr Copycat)

## Minimum requirements

- Node.js v17.1

## Technologies Used:

- Angular v17
- RxJS v7
- Angular Material v17
- Bootstrap v5 (Grid System and utilities)

## Run the project

### Start the Node.js server

I recommend starting the Node.js server before the UI application. With a MongoDB instance available, seed the database, then start the server. More detailed instructions can be found in the [server project](./server/README.md).

### Start the UI application

Once the database contains data and the server is running, the UI application can be started. More details on starting the application can be found in the [UI project](./ui/).
